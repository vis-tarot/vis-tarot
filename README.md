Data Visualization Tarot

This repository is associated with a publication to alt.CHI 2020, ["Divining Insights: Visual Analytics
Through Cartomancy"](https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/altchi-tarot-cameraready.pdf)
You can see the application [here](https://vis-tarot.github.io/vis-tarot/)

The concept of the tool is to replicate the process of "automatically" mining a dataset for insights, but presented in the form of a deck of tarot cards. Select a data set, select a tarot card "spread" and then click the deck to "deal" out new insights one at a time. Reflect on what these insights and their relationships might tell you about the dataset.


## Development

To run the application pick your favorite static asset server (I like live-server), run it! Done!
